## Description ##
(WIP) Plugin that shows maps for map links that do not exist (Ape Atoll Dungeon for example). <br/>
Clicking on a map link shows an image of the dungeon. <br/>
As far as I know, it is not possible to modify the existing map of Runescape. Therefore, static images of maps are shown instead of an interactive map. <br/>
The images are also a certain resolution, so clients that are smaller or bigger than the image resolution will make it look funky.
